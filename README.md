# Collage page design

This it's a page based on pinterest image portal but with
corporative page features added on, like contact and about us pages.

When i made it i was experimenting with Gatbsy and Material UI, so i never
planned to introduce business logic, at least not yet. Maybe in the future.

## Features

* Collage page that shows images using graphQL
* Contact and about us pages
* Home page with styles
* Auth verification pages (Login and register)
* SEO

## Usage

Write in your terminal this commands:

* `git clone https://github.com/desolaser/collage-page.git`
* `cd collage-page`
* `gatsby develop`

Now it should run in your browser, and you can explore the pages freely.

If you want, you can see the design in this [link](https://imagini.lakehosting.cl) instead
